Installation
------------

On unixes, it requires the zlib library (will be linked) and a C compiler to be
able to build LaVision source files.
Then simply type
user@computer:libim7$ python setup.py build
or
user@computer:libim7$ python setup.py install


On windows, as zlib is rarely installed, it is compiled here using scons
